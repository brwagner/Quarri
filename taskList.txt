1)Check System: What things can be picked up, where you can move

CanPickUp: Can pick up a given block.  Can only pick up blocks on the same vertical level as you, that don’t have anything on top of them.
Each block should know if it can be moved - can be updated when a block is added or removed from above it.

CanMove: The given position/square is at most one level above the player

for each block:
UpdateBlockStatus: Updates whether the block can be moved at all


2)Enemy Behaviour:

EnemyMovement:
EnemyAttack:



3)Testing
Just test everything, most likely using Unreal’s Automation System


4)Level Gen System:
*Stretch* Text2Level: Converts a text file representation of a level into an unreal level.
*stretch* randomLevelGeneration

multiple level system:
*stretch* destroyLevel: gets rid of the current level (and clears memory)

has to also reset player to correct position, build next level.
